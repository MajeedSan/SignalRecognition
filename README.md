# Recognizing Events in Time Domain Signals
This python library allows detecting patterns in nd time domain signals
along the time domain axis such force signals.

The library uses the Continuous Wavelet Transform to transform an n dimensional
time domain signal into k\*n dimension signals or k\*n features per
time sample. Then it trains a classifier on the signal.
